Git is a version control system that makes it easy to 

1. collaborate with peers while working on shared tasks
2. enables one to create features whenever without having
to borther about wether the previous feature is safe or not

when using git, make sure that you understand what you need it for

beginning with git

to start using git
-cd to your project directory and then initialize git by entering the command
git init
- go ahead to create a new branch by entering git branch <name of branch to work on>
checkout on that branch by entering git checkout <branch created>

now whatever you do on that directory- be it creating a new folder etc 
are all done on that branch

stage your work on that branch else it wont recognize what you did
to stage- enter git add .
git commit -m "comment goes in the quote"

all you have done is to make a working local git repository, however we need 
to connect online
create a repository online and get the address; this becomes the source repos 
for your local repo

to add this repo to become your online repo use - git add remote origin <name of server>

this will add it to the remote server

now you can push your branch to that remote repo -git push origin <branch name>
